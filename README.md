# Natural-Language-Processing (NLP)
Here problem definition is we are having written reviews of hotel/restraint and we are going to make machine learning model which will tell review is positive or negative.
This is simple example of natural language processing.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is applying Machine Learning models to text and language. Teaching machines to understand what is said in spoken and written word is the focus of Natural Language Processing. Whenever you dictate something into your iPhone / Android device that is then converted to text, thatâ€™s an NLP algorithm in action.
